Numerous agricultural products are utilized on a daily basis, from clothes to bed sheets. Agriculture can be summrized into five words: farming, food, fabric, flowers, and forestry. The origins of agriculture can be traced all the way back to the Fertile Crescent, a region in the Middle East. This region encompasses the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, Turkey, and Iran, as well as the northern region of Kuwait. Agriculture began in the Neolithic era, approximately 10000 BCE and tools were made of stone.\nAgriculture continued to evolve during which new methods and tools for cultivating crops were developed, including crop rotation, mechanical harvesters, steam-powered tractors, and gasoline-powered tractors. Another agricultural boom occurred in the 20th century, specifically in agriculture chemistry, which includes the application of chemical fertilizer, chemical insecticides, and soil composition. Agricultural development is one of the most effective strategies for eradicating extreme poverty and feeding the growing population. Agriculture is also critical for economic growth, accounting for 4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.\nKuwait faces three major challenges in agriculture: first, harsh climate conditions due to the country\u0026rsquo;s dry climate and long, hot summers; second, limited natural water resources; and third, limited agricultural land due to 90 % of land being unsuitable for farming. Kuwait has a lowreliance on subsistence agriculture. Additionally, Kuwait faces a high risk of food insecurity as a result of its lack of self-sufficiency and reliance on imported food, as Kuwait\u0026rsquo;s crop production is limited and primarily consists of grain, potato, and vegetables. In order to tackle this problem Kuwait\u0026rsquo;s Vision 2035 includes a goal of achieving food security by 2035 through sustainable agriculture and encouraging the private sector and foreign companies to invest in new agriculture technologies. As a result, Kuwait now has the largest indoor vertical farm in the Middle East, which was built by the german company \u0026amp;ever.\nThe rapid change in the world and the realization of the scarcity of sustainability has skyrocketed the demand for sustainable, self-sufficient systems that humans can rely on to provide them with the most basic of needs and laying the first block of Maslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of needs which is the physiological needs block (air-water - food). This, combined with the high level of awareness and the appeal of high quality, non-GMO, and organic produce to most and if not all consumers. The team was confronted with this urge to develop a product that could satisfy a small portion of the above idea while utilizing their engineering skills. In this project, the team will thoroughly discuss the process from the day the seed was planted until the crops of hard work were harvested.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/","title":"2- Concept Development","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Market Research Before making any presuppositions, the team have decided to conduct thorough market research using the methods available to them. The team had the opportunity to interview people with some “skin in the game”. The questions were quoted from the textbook of the course “Product Design and Development by Ulrich and Eppinger” to help minimize bias when writing the question. This exercise has provided the team with a substantial amount of information to use as the keystone for the development of the project and to assess the market needs. The raw data gathered from the customers is present below in the form of a question and answer.\nWhen would you use this product?

Automate multi-tasks Upgradable Custom-sized growing area Easy to repair\nThe answers to the previous questions provided the team with the customer and market needs. They gave them an idea about the desired product which must contain the crucial needs. Most of the existing products are expensive to acquire, complex to use \u0026amp; repair, small scale, limited type of crops, and not more than one automated task. This showed that there is a shortage in the market of products that can do more than one automated tasks such as planting the seeds, watering the plants, monitoring the plants health, detecting the weeds, etc. and it can be solved by having a multitasking automated device. The complexity of use and repair can be solved by having a simple interface, useful technical manual, and a community base. The product suppose to fit in a customizable growing area that contain multiple types of crops. The farming device or machine can be built using reasonably reliable materials to have a less expensive product. Achieving the previous needs help with having a healthy and fresh self growing-crops, educational purposes, conducting researches in labs, and working in interesing projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/04_conceptsel/","title":"3- Concept Selection","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Method In this section of the report the team will demonstrate the various methods used to select the final concept, and the different studies/analyses conducted. First, the report will show benchmarking of multiple concepts to validate the targeted specifications and their availability in the market, where the team has selected a total of 6 concepts that are mentioned below in detail to compare with one another. The team has made the decision to include both large-scale and small-scale options due to the lack of small-scale solutions in the market.\nConcept 1 Tertill Tertill is a solar-powered weeding robot that looks for weeds every day. It has a solar panel placed on the top and provides it with all the power needed to detect the weeds within an area of (200 [ft^2], 18.6 [m^2]). There are two techniques to prevent the weeds from growing in the planting area. The first technique uses a weed whacker that cuts the weed depending on the plant\u0026rsquo;s height and it will cut all the plants below half-inch height. The second technique is preventing the weeds from growing during their vulnerable stages by moving the soils repeatedly around them using its wheels. The device uses a touch panel with a good sensitivity level to detect the actual plants and to prevent running into them. The body of the device is made of polycarbonate which can stand through hot and cold climate conditions. There are some limitations to using the device correctly. The device might mistake a short plant for weed and to prevent that, each newly planted seed must be surrounded by a physical barrier longer than half-inch. The plants must be spaced a foot apart from each other for the device to move between them. The weed wacker should be replaced and it lasts for one or two months. The soil level should be balanced to have better performance and prevent the wheels from getting stuck. The device uses a lithium battery that can be charged and keeps the device working through the night. The\nConcept 2 Dino Dino is an automated weeding machine for high scale farming. It uses deep learning to detect the plants, uses a real-time kinematic GPS, sensors, and cameras to navigate and scan the surroundings. It can count the plants and can-do crops mapping. It uses electricity to do the tasks and drive the four motors which are connected to the wheels. The machine covers about 40468.6 [m^2] per day. The price is expected to start from 50,000$ to 100,000$.\nConcept 3 Farmbot Farmbot Genesis is an open-source farming gantry system that can do multiple tasks such as watering, planting, health monitoring, weed detection, and weed elimination. It can do tasks in three dimensions which are the X, Y, and Z-axis. It needs to be connected to electricity around the clock to do its job all the time. The Genesis XL has dimensions of 3 [m] of gantry width and 6 [m] track length which results in 18 [m^2] of planting area. It can grow plants within the maximum height which is 0.5 [m]. Farmbot cost 4,995$ for the Genesis XL latest version.\nConcept 4 AVO AVO is a fully automated robot that is used to eradicate weeds. It is powered by solar panels and equipped with a lidar system that detects obstacles and people. AVO includes embedded software for treating a variety of crops. Additionally, it includes a mobile application that enables remote control. It consumes 95% fewer weedkillers than conventional methods. AVO is 750 kg in weight and uses an ultra-targeted spraying method with an accuracy of 8 x 3 cm to reach each plant. It can cover up to ten hectares per day.\nConcept 5 MARS MARS is a seed-planting mobile agriculture robot. It uses satellite navigation and cloud-based data management to track the location and planting time of each seed. Additionally, it employs an algorithm to determine the optimal path and time required to complete the task. MARS can operate in swarms of six to twelve units that cover an area of one hectare per hour. MARS electric motors have a rating of 400 W and consume 70% less energy than tractors. It is simple to assemble, compact in size, lightweight, and easy to maintain.\nConcept 6 Argas T-16 The Argas T-16 is an automated agriculture drone used to water large areas of plants. It is equipped with a 16-liter tank, four delivery pumps, and eight sprinklers. The drone can cover ten hectares per hour. It is equipped with a radar system that utilizes digital beamforming technology to operate the drone at any time of day or night. Additionally, this technology scans the area for obstacles. The drone\u0026rsquo;s control range is 3 kilometers. Under normal operating conditions, the Argas T-16 is dustproof, waterproof, and corrosion-resistant. Figure 23: Concept 6 (Argas T-16) 34\nComparison between concepts To compare the aforementioned concepts and products that are available the team has drawn up a concept selection matrix. The concept selection matrix is the resulting matrix from comparing multiple concepts with one another to help select the final design, in this process the team used available products in the market and benchmarked them with the list of customer needs generated in phase 1. Below the matrix is present, and the key for each needs to help in reading and understanding the table. In each column, a [+] represent a need being met with \u0026hellip; better than the target specification, a [0] shows that either the product doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the required feature or it can be upgraded to allow for the required feature, a [-] value indicated that the feature doesn’t exist and in no way the product can allow for making it available.\n   Key Imp Tertill Dino Farmbot AVO MARS Argas T16     1 5 [+] [-] [+] [-] [+] [+]   2 5 [0] [-] [+] [-] [0] [+]   3 5 [-] [-] [+] [-] [-] [+]   4 5 [+] [+] [+] [+] [-] [-]   5 3 [-] [-] [+] [-] [-] [-]   6 2 [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-]   7 1 [-] [-] [0] [-] [-] [-]   8 5 [0] [+] [+] [+] [0] [+]   9 5 [+] [+] [+] [+] [+] [+]   10 4 [-] [-] [+] [-] [-] [-]   11 5 [+] [0] [0] [0] [+] [0]   12 3 [-] [-] [+] [-] [-] [-]   13 5 [-] [-] [+] [-] [-] [+]   14 3 [-] [0] [+] [0] [-] [+]   15 5 [0] [0] [+] [0] [0] [+]   16 1 [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-]   17 4 [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0]   18 5 [+] [+] [+] [+] [-] [-]   19 4 [+] [-] [+] [+] [+] [+]   20 3 [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-]   21 2 [-] [0] [0] [0] [-] [0]   22 3 [-] [-] [0] [-] [-] [-]   23 3 [-] [-] [0] [-] [-] [-]   24 5 [-] [0] [+] [0] [+] [-]   Sum +  6 4 15 5 5 9   Sum -  -14 -14 -3 -13 -15 -12   Sum 0  4 6 6 6 4 3   Net Score  -8 -10 12 -8 -10 -3   Rank  3 5 1 3 5 2    The table above shows the results for the selection matrix, as it is seen that most of the products have a net score of (-) and this is due to the reason that the customer needs were generated with the targeted customer being small scale and home farmers, and as it was mentioned in the phase 1 report that the majority of the available products in the market serves the large scale farming industry with no regards to the small sale consumer, and since the target is the small scale farmer, purchasing multiple devices to automate multiple tasks is not feasible. Making the decision to go with Farmbot as the starting point for development in this project is the obvious decision due to it meeting the required criteria and covering a wide range of the desired customer needs.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/05_farmbot/","title":"4- Farmbot","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Product Architecture Farmbot offers a wide variety of options to select from when purchasing a farmbot device there are multiple decisions to consider, in the beginning the customer should deicide on the level of automation desired in the device as farmbot offers two main version which are the Farmbot Express and the Farmbot Genesis. The Farmbot Express offers a lower level of automation, it doesnt have x axis tracks as it it runs over the raised bed meaning the customer must make sure the surface would allow for such motion and it has less computing power, for the Genesis version of the Farmbot, it offers a higher level of automation where it is more a set it and forget it for most of the time type of device, and it has greater computing power. The farmbot Express is more suitable for the customer who is willing to have daily interaction with their Farmbot. The Genesis is more suitable for scale operations as the time required to upkeep the device is lower, but on the other hand it will require more knowledge in electronics and simple mechanics as it has more components thus more points of failure. After selecting the version of farmbot that is desired, then comes the other decision of deciding the growing are for each device. Both the Genesis and the Express have regular size version with a growing dimension of (1.5m x 3m) 4.5m2 and (1.2m x 3m) 3.6m2 respectively. For the XL version the Express offers a maximum growing are of (2.4m x 6m) 14.4m2 and the Genesis Xl has a growing area of (3m x 6m) 18m2. All farmbot devices can be modified for personal projects and different use cases, it can also be inside a greenhouse with a controller for environmental variables (seperate and not part of Farmbot products).\nDetails of the Farmbot product For demonstration purposes and to meet the required customer needs the team has decided to analyze the advanced version of Farmbot, which is the newly released Genesis V1.6. (https://genesis.farm.bot/v1.6/assembly/intro) Farmbot Genesis is the most sophisticated Farmbot model which comes with the most useful features and it is flexible since most of the parts can be replaced with new parts that can be useful to accomplish new tasks and functionalities. It can grow plants, protect them, and take care of them with the highest level of precision. The tools and the functionality of the device can be modified to run experiments which helps improve the agricultural industry. Genesis has two versions depending on the size of the device. One of the versions is called Genesis which has a gantry width of 1.5 [m] and track length of 3[m]. The other version is called Genesis XL which islarger, its gantry width is 3 [m], and its track length is 6 [m]. Both of the versions have a maximum plant height of 0.5 [m] and they are shown in the figure below.\nThere are two ways to mount the device on the planting field. The first way is to mount it on a bed. There are two types of beds which are a fixed raised bed and mobile raised bed as shown in the figure below. Genesis requires a bed size of an outer width of 1.48 [m] and the recommended outer bed length is 3 [m]. Genesis XL requires a bed size of an outer width of 2.98 [m] and the recommended outer bed length is 6 [m]. The second way is to mount on wood posts and it is called pier block supports.\nFarmBot Genesis V 1.6 uses two tracks to enable the gantry to move precisely along the x- axis. They are designed to be attached to a raised bed or other similar structure. Each track is made up of 1.5m-long aluminum extrusions that are connected end-to-end to create a 3m-long track for the Genesis model. By removing or adding a section of the aluminum extrusion, the tracks can be shortened or lengthened. According to the Farmbot website, assembling the tracks should take between two and twelve hours, depending on the size of the bed used. Plates are used to secure the tracks to the bed. Plates are classified into two types: track end plates and track joining plates. The track end plate is used to secure the start and end of the tracks to the bed, whereas the track joining plate is used to connect and secure the extrusions to the bed.\nThe figure shows the 3d model of the the whole assembly of the track and plates attached to the bed.\nThe gantry acts as the y-axis for Farmbot and made of V-slot aluminum extrusion. The gantry is attached to the tracks by gantry wheel plates. Two motors are attached to each side of the gantry to allow it to move in the x-axis, the gantry is designed in this style where it is elevated above the bed level to minimise interference with any growing plants. The estimated time required to assemble the gantry is two hours.\nThis figure shows Farmbot\u0026rsquo;s z-axis, which is used to plant seeds, water plants, eliminate weeds, and monitor soil moisture using a universal tool mount. It is able to slide on the gantry using a cross-slide which shown in the figure below.\nAfter assembling all of the parts mentioned above the completed model of the Farmbot Genesis V1.6 will look like the 3D mockup shown in the figure below.\nThe figure above shows a picture of the 3D model of the completed device including all the parts. After connecting and assembling all the parts together, the final product should be a fully functioning device that can plant the seeds, water the plants, detect the weeds, eliminate the weeds, read the soil properties, and monitor the planting area along with the plants' health using a camera. The device uses a 3D printed mount called the universal tool mount which can be attached and connected to a tool using magnets. The universal mount shown in the figure below.\nIn order to water the plants the device will connect the universal tool mount with the watering tool which is the watering nozzle and it is shown in the figure below. The device has a pressure regulator to control the water output. Since it is an open source product the watering tool can be redesigned using its 3D model to change the water output.\nThe figure above shows the water nozzle attached to the universal tool mount during the plants watering process. As shown in the figure the water stream has been defused using the water nozzle to prevent the plants from getting damaged from the concentrated water stream.\nThe figure above shows the seed planting tool which is called the seeder or the seed injector. The tool includes a needle that can be changed by the user depending on the seed\u0026rsquo;s size. The concept is to use a vacuum pump to suction and hold the seed and inject it into the ground at the selected location. The device will go back and forth picking up the seeds from a cup or an external source and to the selected locations. The two tools shown above are the tools that have been used to kill the weeds in their vulnerable stages. One of the wedding tools is called the weeder which kills the weed by smashing and pushing them into the ground which prevent the weeds from growing. The other tool is called the rotary tool which has a DC motor and two blades to cut the weeds besides its other functions such as soil surface milling and an additional function which is 5 [mm] drilling which requires a drilling chuck. The figure above shows the soil sensor tool which helps getting an accurate reading for the soil properties. It has a moisture sensor that can measure the soil moisture which gives indications and information about the amount of water in the soil. The right side of the figure shows the soil sensor during the soil moisture measuring process. The figure above shows an actual existing product. It shows the variety of crops that can be grown using the device ( such as: spinach,beets, etc.) . The used device in the figure is the Genesis XL version 1.6 which is the latest version. Farmbot is controlled by a custom microcontroller known as farmdunio. This microcontroller communicates via G-code with a Raspbery Pi. The stepper motors, universal tool mount, and other peripherals are controlled by Farmdunio. Additionally, it provides power to all electronic components. The Raspbery Pi, on the other hand, is in charge of tracking plants, taking photos, and controlling the push buttons. The electronic components are contained in a container referred to as the electronics box that is attached to the gantry. The figures below show the different components of the electronic box.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/06_prototype/","title":"5- Prototype","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Due to the previously mentioned reasons and the inability to acquire and set up a fully functional Farmbot device the team has decided to split the validation of the problem-solution into multiple segments and by doing so the team will also better satisfy the engineering analysis objective of this capstone project with hands-on experience in mimicking the behavior of a Farmbot by developing its own autonomous weed like detection software to identify objects and burn them with laser as if they were weeds. The team has also made sure that the laser module used is capable of burning weed in the second section of this validation process, and finally, the components to integrate the laser module with Farmbot were designed using CAD software and fabricated and tested for fit using a 3D printer.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/07_concludingremarks/","title":"6- Concluding Remarks","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Kuwait has a major issue in self-sufficient systems especially in the agriculture field, the percentage of self-sufficient agriculture has been dropping since 2015 (latest statistics available for 2019), which is a problem worth solving. A market for self-sufficient and sustainable systems exists in the region and the customer awareness is increasing. Open-source projects are gaining more traction and are of high appeal to customers, especially when products can be upgradable and customizable. Using visual tools for project planning can dramatically increase the efficiency of information communicated throughout the team, an example used is Gantt charts. Functional decomposition is a powerful technique that can be used to influence the decision-making process when upgrading a specific functionality in a device with multiple sub-systems. Automation is taking over the agriculture industry as some devices can simply replace tens if not hundreds of employees and do the job more efficiently. Solutions for automation in the agriculture industry have been limited to large scale farms with very expensive equipment making the barrier of entry huge for the world of automation. Farmbot (the selected concept) is one of the first eco-systems that offer a multi-level automation and is targeted for actual farming and not just maintaining a single plant. Farmbot can be used in a plethora of scenarios ranging from greenhouses to labs and simply outdoor in the sun, with the capability of customizing each device to serve specific goals for specific conditions and different objectives. The economic analysis showed that Farmbot is a feasible device to be used in Kuwait with a breakeven period of less than 3 years in the worst-case scenario. Economic analysis concluded that Farmbot is a feasible solution for households and showed promising results for restaurants with the dream to use exotic produce all year long. Contacting the manufacturer of a product is a necessary step to validate a problem thought to exist in a device before attempting to solve it – it can also lead to a collaboration with the manufacturer. Using multiple levels for proof of concept is an efficient technique before fully investing in a solution that does not deliver on results. Teamwork is a crucial aspect in the development of any project/product since all members have different backgrounds and skills that can influence the success of the project differently.

Awareness is increasing and it’s driving the demand for sustainable solutions which was validated with market research. A collaboration with a company that builds autonomous agricultural robots, Farmbot, forms the base for this project where the feasibility of the product is studied for the region showing promising results of break-even period less than 3 years for the worst case. The weeding mechanism was switched from motors to efficient lasers with no moving components, which eliminated unwanted vibrations and power draws. The laser was evaluated by developing a totally separate weed detection and elimination method in MATLAB using smart vision systems and a 3D printer assembly. Components required for the Farmbot upgrade were designed, and prototypes were built and tested to confirm that the expected outcomes were achieved.\nThis is the link\nThis website is powered by no body documentation to learn how to use click on this\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/conceptgen/","title":"A - Concept Generations","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The team conducted extensive research on existing solutions in the market for both large- and small-scale applications when developing the concept for this project. After spending sufficient time independently researching solutions, the team decided to hold a meeting for a couple of brainstorming sessions during which they employed a variety of brainstorming strategies and concluded the series of brainstorming sessions with a set of concept sketches generated using the C-sketch method, as illustrated below.\nIdea 1 The concept presented in the figure above suggests the use of drones, each with specific functionality, and all drones are dispatched from a base. The drones are self-controlled and are connected with a detection system that is equipped with multiple sensors buried underground and a smart vision system. The main advantage of this system is the flexibility of the growing area as it is not bounded by a frame and the requirements are the same for a wide range of growing areas. The main problem with the system is the complexity of the autonomous drone system and the high possibility of failure combined with the difficulty of troubleshooting.\nIdea 2 The second generated concept proposes a rail system that goes around the growing area, and the rail system itself is the method of delivery for supplies. Mounting holes in fixed distances are present on the rails and an arm that moves on the rails and connects to the ports/holes is used to deliver the supplies from the storage area to the desired location. Supplies transported in the rail system can range from supplements to water and seeds. An advantage of this system is the simple components to be used in it and their availability in the market, with the main disadvantage being the limited growing area and the high number of parts.\nIdea 3 The third developed concept suggests the use of a greenhouse as the mainframe with a railing system embedded inside of it similar to the one discussed in the previously proposed solution (I2). other than the rail system the greenhouse is equipped with climate control components which is a desired feature in the region due to the extreme weather conditions. The added benefit for this concept above what was earlier mentioned is the wide range of plants available for growing because of the greenhouse, which also introduces the limitation of the growing area and the required maintenance of the arm and rail system.\nIdea 4 The last generated concept proposes the use of a camera in combination with sensors buried in the ground as the input to the system with a system of pipes underground to deliver supplies and water to the plants. The camera and sensors will monitor the health of plants and growing stages. This system should be easily upgradable due to the simplicity of components used, the main disadvantage is the high pumpkin power required for the delivery of supplies and the difficulty associated with repairing and changing faulty sensors. The concepts generated were discussed briefly to show the process used in the concept generation phase, all concepts have more depth than what is shown and mentioned, only the relevant information was mentioned. And the final selected concept is discussed thoroughly in the following stages of the report\nFinal Selected Idea After numerous discussion sessions, the team has decided on a combination of Ideas 2 and 3, where it will be a frame system with a simple arm that moves alongside it and will be located inside a temperature-controlled greenhouse. The system will meet the following specifications and include the following features:\n A greenhouse with lights and a camera attached to the ceiling The greenhouse with a fan to control airflow and temperature The greenhouse with a humidifier to control humidity The greenhouse with a rail system on the outside edge The module with an arm that is vertical when not in use A module carrying the arm that has a predetermined location for it to rest and connect to the valve/connection The tracks also serve as the delivery system for water and supplements The connection/valve on the track is how the water and supplements get from the tracks to the arm The arm is considered a rail that has a module connected to it with the necessary tools (Soil PH - soil temp - soil humidity - Solid health) A camera mounted on the green house\u0026rsquo;s ceiling will monitor the emergence of weeds and plant growth, as well as determine when crops are ready for harvest. Automatically triggered lights on the ceiling will simulate sunlight and provide necessary exposure.

After generating the tables in the appendix the following graphs were plotted to better help understand the results. For the first two figures show the results for the small scale options of owning 1 device and the expenses over time associated with each of the options available to the consumer.\nIn the previously presented figures the numbers associated with operating and owning a Farmbot are plotted to help better understand the data. The first plot in the form aof a bar chat shows the cumulative expenses over the years, whereas the second plot show the break even points for all options available and as it can be noticed that the Farmbot Express will break even after approximately 6 months to a year whereas the Farmbot Genies breaks even before the 3 year mark and the costs associated with the buying the vegetables from stores keeps on increasing with a higher rate than either options of the Farmbot. For the following graphs the same concept above is used but for a bigger sized growing area were made as the Farmbot family offers an XL version for both the Farmbot Express and the Farmbot Genies, and their respective calculations can be found in the following figures.\nSimilar to the figures above for the single regular size Farmbot the numbers for the XL versions of the Farmbot were studied and plotted as shown in figures 35 and 36. Both version the regular and the XL share about the same breakeven point, but as it will be discovered in the next part of the ROI study when upscaling with multiple devices more interesting results show up. For the following and last section of the ROI calculations the comparison of owning multiple Farmbot devices were compared and the cumulative profit for each scenario was plotted against time as it can be found the two following figures.\nFor the figures above the 0 line represents the breakeven point for each device since each line in both plots represent the cumulative profit in comparison to simply buying the vegetables from stores (using previously made assumptions). As it can be noticed from figure 37 which shows the calculations for owning multiple Farmbot Express XL devices the breakeven point for all options ranging from owning 1 to 5 devices the breakeven point is met before the second quarter of the second year and this option shows promising results especially for restaurant owners who are looking for having exotic herbs and vegetables as parts of their menus. Another observation made from the plot is that at the point where all the lines share the same point is that at that specific point have more devices beats the numbers of having any less so the number of devices owned can be derived only by the produce needs of the owner. For the second figure the same numbers were plotted but for the Farmbot Genies XL version and it is obvious that the device will cost more but yet it might have different use cases as this option offers a wider range of automations and different capabilities that might also be suited for the regular user or possibly to be used in labs which will have a different way for calculating the ROI since it’s a completely different game.\nIn Conclusion In conclusion Farmbot present itself as a feasible solution for multiple types of consumers especially that it is already a feasible solution when only considering produce that is available in the market and that is reasonably priced. Farmbot can be considered an even more feasible option when the consumer is trying to scratch more than one itch, it is an extremely appealing product to restaurants especially ones that would like to infuse their dishes with exotic vegetables and fruits that are not easy to find or extremely seasonal (will require extra investment for green house). Farmbot is also considered an amazing STEM project for to build as a family projecy or it can be used for even more complex applications in labs and other facilities for experimental purposes.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/06_prototype/proof/","title":"A - Proof of Concept","tags":[],"description":"","content":"To validate the proposed solution with the limited budget constraint, it was decided to use a 3D printer to replication a Farmbot. The 3D printer was modified to have a webcam attached to it to be used as the weed scanning tool, and the laser to be used in the finalized Farmbot was also attached to the 3D printer to be a part of the prototype.\nThe figure above shows the exact model used in the fabrication of the prototype and the choice of a 3D printer was obvious as it has a 3 axis gantry system which is exactly what Farmbot uses but this has a much smaller form factor and is widely available and more affordable. The reasons behind why this exact model was chosen are due to its low price and the fact that it has an open-source microcontroller and software that allowed the team to fully control the 3D printer through a serial connection with a USB cable. Since this is not a growing area and having weeds will cause a mess the weed was replaced with a red circle and a red whiteboard magnet such as the one presented in the figure below was used Assembly As mentioned previously the 3D printer had a camera and a laser module attached to it. A custom-designed mounting bracket was designed specifically for this application and then it was printed using the 3D printer.\nThe custom-designed mount is shown in the figure above. The mount allowed for a seamless mounting arrangement that did not impair nor interfere with the 3D printing functionality.\nThe figure above shows the completed assembly of the prototype used for the purpose of the validation process.\nComputer Program To control the assembly a computer program was developed to drive the mechanisms a satisfy the required physical objective, which is to the red magnet representing a weed and pinpoint its exact location and then triggers the laser and moves the laser around the red magnet to make sure that if it was a weed that it is most likely to be burnt. For the purpose of this project, MATLAB was since it was the programming tool with which the team members are familiar using.\nThe logic for the computer program used to control the system is presented in the diagram in the figure above. When the device is first turned on it will calibrate its location and then go to the idle home location waiting for a command to search for weeds. The search for weeds command can be triggered either by a specific event such as time i.e. 7:00 am every Sunday or manually. After the scan command is triggered the computer software will drive the motors to move the camera to multiple locations to take a snapshot of the bed which in this case represents the growing area, then the previously taken images are stitched together to make the full image of the bed as shown below\nThe figure above shows the images taken at a different location and then the stitched version. After stitching the images, the final stitched image is then referenced to real-life coordinates of the bed. After having a way to convert pixel location to mm location on the bed of the 3D printer, the image is analyzed and a mask is applied where anything that is red in the image is then turned into white with everything else being black as shown in the figure below.\nIn the figure above it shows the masked red regions with boxes around them. The reason for the boxes is to be able to get the XY pixel location for the red magnets and to eliminate the noise in the image by only considering the boxes that meet certain criteria (in this case the area of the box) and reject all other boxes. The information of all confirmed boxes is then stored in a matrix format. After location each red magnet the 3D printer is then instructed to take the camera to the location of the first red dot in the matrix of red dots (order is not important in this case), the reason the camera is first taken to the red magnet before the laser is to pinpoint the exact location of the red magnet with a certain accuracy which reduces any errors from the previous location estimation process in a dramatic manner. The figure above shows the location of the red magnet before the enhancement and after and as it can be concluded that a great deal of correction has taken place. After doing so the distance from the head of the laser and the camera lens is known (in this case it is 48mm in the X and 23 mm in the Y). The printer will bring the lens of the laser to the center of the red magnet and then trigger the laser. In the figure the pattern of which the laser will burn the weed is shown, the reason this pattern (The Archimedean Spiral) was chosen was that the magnet was circular and it was fairly simple to manipulate without causing any damage to the bed of the 3D printer, another pattern is used when a weed is to be eliminated)\nPseudo-code After describing what happens in each operation of the code the pseudo-code is presented for each function below (Taking into consideration)\nInitiation Scanning the area Detecting Red Dots Honing In On Red Dots Eliminating The Red Dot Testing and Results In the figure below the red magnets used are shown before and after the burning process using the laser\nAs it can be seen that the laser was capable of melting the plastic cover of the white board magnet indicating that it will be powerful enough to burn organic leafs which will also be demonstrated in the following section of the report. The pattern used for attack (Archamedian spiral) can also be seen in the second burnt magnet on the right hand side.\nProof of concept - weed elimination In this section the results for burning an actual weed are shown. In the first figure below a small plant demonstrating a weed (in size) is used in a small, a perfectly healthy small plant. The plant in the figure above will go throught the burning process and the results are shown below in the next figure.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/05_farmbot/bom/","title":"B - Bill of material","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This tables below show the required quantity and the price of each component.

A laser housing was designed using COMSOL to be used in the weed elimination process. To have a better understanding of the designed parts look at the figure below which shows the part from four different dimensions. The final design should be able to be attached to the Farmbot weeder tool using a couple of screws.\nAfter designing the final model of the laser housing was manufactured by a 3D printer using a filament made of thermoplastic polymer (PLA) which is made of renewable resources (recycled material). The laser was able to fit inside the housing with a very small clearance of value 1 [mm] at each side. The minimum wall thickness equals to 2.25 [mm] which can be seen on the top walls of the cylinder. The final 3D printed laser housing is shown in the figure below. The figure below shows the Farmbot weeder tool which can be attached to their universal tool mount using magnets as mentioned before. It can be manufactured using a 3D printer and it is shown in the figures below. The laser housing can relate to the weeder tool using a couple of screws as shown in the figures below.\nAfter connecting the laser housing with the weeder tool, it will be ready to attach it with the universal tool mount which is equipped with most of Farmbot devices. The three big holes on the top of the weeder tool are for attaching the magnets with it using screws. The other small holes on the around the weeder top are for the wiring. To achieve the target, which is eliminating the weed, The laser should have enough power to burn the weed. The used laser made by Creality, and it has a blue violet beam. The laser has enough power of 500 mA, and it can burn a weed and it is shown in the figure below.\nThe figure above shows the laser wiring and all the needed fasteners from a Top view. The Laser has two wires which can be used to connect the laser with Farmbot devices.The Wires use the small holes of the weeder tool and they can be connected with universal tool mount using the electronic screws to supply the laser with required power and using the magnets to attach and carry the whole tool.\n The final design should be ready to work after connecting it with a Farmbot devise using the universal tool mount, The red wire will be connected to a Farmbot power supply, and the black wire will be connected with a Farmbot board. The same method will be used to detect the weeds as the other weed killing tools which Farmbot already designed.

The third column shows the metric itself followed by its importance in the next column, and finally, the unit for each metric can be found in the last column.\nTarget Specifications The product specifications are objective, precise, and measurements of the product performance and by meeting the specifications, the product meets customer requirements as defined in the Textbook. In order to obtain the specifications, the customer needs were organized into a hierarchy and each need was assigned with an importance and a metric as it was shown in the presented information above. The current target specifications are based on the components available in the market and/or the interpreted needs based on the understanding of the team members. The target specifications discussed below are not final and are subject to change after further market research is done. The change will be made with the objective of positioning the developed product in the area that allows for targeting the desired customer and keeping the costs as low as possible. The assumed target specifications are shown in table xx below with the justification (if any) for each one of them.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/06_prototype/bom/","title":"C - Bill of Material","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The table below lists the equipment and tools used for this project, both the proof of concept and design and fabrication of the laser housing for Farmbot\n   Item $/Unit Qty Total     Creality Laser Engraver 37.99 1 37.99$   Creality Ender 3 Pro 3D Printer 219 1 219$   1KG Ender PLA Filament 23.29 1 23.29$   Logitech C310 HD WEBCAM 34.99 1 34.99$   Misc. costs 100 1 100$    "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/functional-decomposition/","title":"C - Functional Decomposition","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Watering This diagram illustrates the function decomposition for automatic plant watering. Three system inputs are required: energy in the form of electrical power, water in the form of a fluid, and a command informing the system that it is time to water the plants. The system has two outputs: water to be released on the plants and a signal confirming the plant watering process. When the energy input is accepted as external energy and used to increase the water pressure, the water input is accepted by the system, and the command indicating the plant\u0026rsquo;s needs is accepted, the watering process is initiated. The system will accept the water input and use the energy input to increase the pressure of the water, which will then wait at the end of a valve for the watering input command to release the water flow and accomplish the objective of watering the plants, triggering the output.\nWeeding The figure above illustrates the functional decomposition required for weeding. After receiving the command to check for weeds, the system uses electrical energy to scan the area and, if a weed is detected, the system moves the weeder in accordance with the weed\u0026rsquo;s location and size. After that, the weeder will begin eradicating the weed and will signal when it is complete. In contrast, if the area is scanned and no weeds are detected, the system will transmit a signal indicating that no weeds were detected. The weeding functional decomposition helped with choosing the mechanisms and techniques of the subsystems as follow: The figure above shows the classification tree for accepting the external energy. Answering the following questions were useful to choose the techniques:\n What kind of energy need to be saved? Is it a renewable power source or it doesn’t matter? What kind of power source? Results in choosing the wall outlet which is a non-renewable power source for electrical energy.  The figure above shows the classification tree for weed elimination. Answering the following questions was useful to choose the techniques:\n What are the techniques that can be used? Is it a combination of more than one? What tools can be used for each technique? Result in choosing a laser which is an electrical tool capable of burning the weeds.  The figure above shows the classification tree for the area scanning techniques Answering the following questions were useful to choose the techniques:\n What kind of scanner needs to be used? What kind of scanning tool? How does the scanning tool work? Result in choosing a regular video camera to scan the planting area and looks for weeds.  Seed Planting This figure shows the functional decomposition for seed planting. The system has three inputs: energy in the form of electrical power to supply the system with the necessary power to perform the tasks, The seeds are used as the planting material, and a command is used to inform the system about the plants. The system has two outputs: the seed as the material pushed beneath the soil at the proper depth and a signal informing the system of the planting\u0026rsquo;s completion and information. When external energy is accepted and used to power the seed collection and planting mechanisms, seeds are stored and planted, and the planting command is accepted to initiate the planting process, the inputs and outputs interact.\nSupplement System This figure shows the functional breakdown of the supplement system. The system will begin by scanning for deficiencies in the plants and storing the necessary supplements. The system will then send a signal indicating the location and type of supplement required if a deficiency is detected in a plant. Following that, it will direct the nozzle to the desired location and increase the supplement\u0026rsquo;s pressure using electrical energy. This process results in the release of the supplement onto the plant, along with a signal indicating its presence. If no deficiency is detected, the system will send a signal indicating that the plant did not require additional nutrients.\nClimate Control This is figure illustrates the functional decomposition for the climate control system. The system has five inputs: energy in the form of electrical power, water as the fluid, and three signals that inform the system about the temperature, humidity, and time. The system produces no outputs because it is constantly monitoring the climate conditions. The system is designed to accept ally electrical energy, and distribute it to the conditioning devices. Accept the water and use it to humidify or dehumidify the surrounding environment. The system will determine whether the current climate conditions are desirable or not and will turn on/off the conditioning devices accordingly.\nHarvesting This is the harvesting system\u0026rsquo;s functional decomposition. The system will begin scanning the area immediately for crops that require harvesting. If crops are detected, the system transmits a signal to the picker indicating their location, which the picker then moves to using electrical energy. The picker will then collect the crops and determine if additional crops need to be harvested or stored. If, on the other hand, the system detects that the crops are still growing, it will send a signal indicating that no further action is required.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/05_farmbot/weederprob/","title":"C - Weeder Problem","tags":[],"description":"","content":"As previously stated, the device employs a rotary tool equipped with a 24 [v] DC motor to kill weeds, which may result in undesirable vibration throughout the system. After repeated use, the rotary blades may become damaged, resulting in blade imbalance. Unbalanced blades will generate a series of vibrations that will travel from the motor to the gantry. Vibrations will affect both the tool and the universal mount, dislocating them and potentially affecting their alignment and accuracy. The figure below shows the parts which might be affected by the vibrations.\nThe cross-slide might be affected by the vibrations by loosening up the belt shown in the figure below and leading to an unstable movement along the gantry.\nBesides the vibration problem, there are additional issues such as the weeder\u0026rsquo;s power consumption and weeder limitation. Due to the length of the blades, the weeder can only target large weeds and cannot eliminate small weeds. Additionally, because it is imprecise, it may cause damage to nearby plants. After stating all of these issues, it\u0026rsquo;s evident that the primary improvement to Farmbot would be to implement a different method of weeding. An email was sent to the Farmbot company to discuss feasible product improvements (can be found in the Appendix)\nInitial Solution Approach Since the Farmbot already has a UTM (universal tool mount) system then and the weed wacker is not fixed to the actual device then it can easily be swapped with a powerful laser module that has a UTM end on to it that can easily be operated by the same current software on the Farmbot with minor code adjustments. The following figures will show the initial design components and the general idea around the laser module to be added to the system which will be extensively discussed in the final Phase 3 version of the report.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/04_conceptsel/finalselection/","title":"Final Concept Selection","tags":[],"description":"","content":"After Reviewing multiple concepts and extensive research conducted for the previously mentioned products that are available in the market. The team has selected the Farmbot product as the starting point for their development. This decision was made for various reasons with the primary factor - contributing to this decision-making process - being the fact that in the benchmarking table shown previously the Farmbot concept covers most of the required target specifications discussed in the phase 1 report. Other important reasons have also played a great role in making the decision and they are listed below.\nCourse and budget limitations Unfortunately, the nature of this Capstone Design Course offers limited resources and a short timeline for the delivery of a proven and prototyped concept which in a way forces the team to settle with a simple or minor concept/problem to develop or fix. Thus, after looking at the various concepts discussed in the previous section from both budget and timeline perspectives the best decision was to select an already available concept in the market and direct the efforts of the team and their available resources to solve a problem with the existing concept or enhance its performance. For the limitations, the team has decided to select the Farmbot option shown previously.\nRequired experience and manufacturing capability Fully developing a concept from the ground up to require a great deal of previous experience which the team has none. Also, the lack of workshops in Kuwait and on-campus in combination with the limited raw material available especially for prototyping poses a barrier in the face of development and manufacturing.\nOther reasons After contacting the manufacturer of Farmbot, the team was able to get crucial information about one of the mechanisms available in the product, which was the undesired weed wacking mechanism on the device (this will be discussed extensively later on), this mechanism introduced undesired vibrations to the system and had a fairly large minimum radius. The team was also able to coordinate with the manufacturer of Farmbot to figure out a procedure to use their developed design and weeding mechanism to be added to the open- source Farmbot project, meaning that the development done in this course will be used in a real-life project that other people can use for no cost, this fact contributed greatly in the selection of Farmbot. After further discussion with the people working on the Farmbot project it was decided that the team needs to do is develop a new weed eliminating mechanism thus it eliminated the cost of acquiring the full automated farming device, and now the team only needs to use minimal parts from the actual Farmbot device to make sure their developed concept is compliant with Farmbot and work on the integration from the newly developed concept side of things (will be discussed extensively).\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/02_missionstatement/missionstatement/","title":"Mission Statement","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The first step in developing any project especially when it is focused and the attempt of solving a real-life problem that can touch the lives of a great deal of people is to have a well-defined well written mission statement and use it to guide the efforts of the team towards the solution.
