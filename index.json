Numerous agricultural products are utilized on a daily basis, from clothes to bed sheets. Agriculture can be summrized into five words: farming, food, fabric, flowers, and forestry. The origins of agriculture can be traced all the way back to the Fertile Crescent, a region in the Middle East. This region encompasses the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, Turkey, and Iran, as well as the northern region of Kuwait. Agriculture began in the Neolithic era, approximately 10000 BCE and tools were made of stone.\nAgriculture continued to evolve during which new methods and tools for cultivating crops were developed, including crop rotation, mechanical harvesters, steam-powered tractors, and gasoline-powered tractors. Another agricultural boom occurred in the 20th century, specifically in agriculture chemistry, which includes the application of chemical fertilizer, chemical insecticides, and soil composition. Agricultural development is one of the most effective strategies for eradicating extreme poverty and feeding the growing population. Agriculture is also critical for economic growth, accounting for 4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. [2] Kuwait faces three major challenges in agriculture: first, harsh climate conditions due to the country\u0026rsquo;s dry climate and long, hot summers; second, limited natural water resources; and third, limited agricultural land due to 90 % of land being unsuitable for farming. Kuwait has a lowreliance on subsistence agriculture. Additionally, Kuwait faces a high risk of food insecurity as a result of its lack of self-sufficiency and reliance on imported food, as Kuwait\u0026rsquo;s crop production is limited and primarily consists of grain, potato, and vegetables. In order to tackle this problem Kuwait\u0026rsquo;s Vision 2035 includes a goal of achieving food security by 2035 through sustainable agriculture and encouraging the private sector and foreign companies to invest in new agriculture technologies. As a result, Kuwait now has the largest indoor vertical farm in the Middle East, which was built by the german company \u0026amp;ever. [3] The rapid change in the world and the realization of the scarcity of sustainability has skyrocketed the demand for sustainable, self-sufficient systems that humans can rely on to provide them with the most basic of needs and laying the first block of Maslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of needs which is the physiological needs block (air-water - food). This, combined with the high level of awareness and the appeal of high quality, non-GMO, and organic produce to most and if not all consumers. The team was confronted with this urge to develop a product that could satisfy a small portion of the above idea while utilizing their engineering skills. In this project, the team will thoroughly discuss the process from the day the seed was planted until the crops of hard work were harvested.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/","title":"Concept Development","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Market Research Before making any presuppositions, the team have decided to conduct thorough market research using the methods available to them. The team had the opportunity to interview people with some “skin in the game”. The questions were quoted from the textbook of the course “Product Design and Development by Ulrich and Eppinger” to help minimize bias when writing the question. This exercise has provided the team with a substantial amount of information to use as the keystone for the development of the project and to assess the market needs. The raw data gathered from the customers is present below in the form of a question and answer.\nWhen would you use this product? Desire healthy/fresh/organic self-grown crops at home Conducting research in labs or a personal experiment Educational tool to satisfy most STEM objectives Interesting project to work on and manage (enthusiasts)\nWhy would you use this product? To automate farming/growing tasks such as Water plants Planting seeds Eliminate weeds Monitor the health of plants Control the environment (greenhouse) Supplement plant (health management through vitamins and pH) Harvest crops\nTypical session of using this product? Phase 1: (Plan growing needs - purchase seeds - ask the device to plant) Phase 2: (Device should plant seeds - the device should grow plants) Phase 3: Device must harvest crops Phase 4: Clean and prep growing area for new cycle\nWhat do you like about this product? Community-based Automate some tasks Easy to use Efficient and reliable (time-saving) No assembly requirement\nWhat do you dislike about this product? Not enough small-scale options in the market Most available solutions offer a single automation Complexity of repairs \u0026amp; troubleshooting Expensive to acquire Small-scale has a very limited growing area Limited crops variety in available solutions\nWhat issues do you consider when purchasing the product? Price to acquire and fix Ease of fixing and troubleshooting Range of crops (types) What is it automating (what tasks) Ease of use and setup Growing space/area Indoor and outdoor capability Is there a community built around the product? Reliability\nWhat improvements would you make to existing products? Automate multi-tasks Upgradable Custom-sized growing area Easy to repair\nThe answers to the previous questions provided the team with the customer and market needs. They gave them an idea about the desired product which must contain the crucial needs. Most of the existing products are expensive to acquire, complex to use \u0026amp; repair, small scale, limited type of crops, and not more than one automated task. This showed that there is a shortage in the market of products that can do more than one automated tasks such as planting the seeds, watering the plants, monitoring the plants health, detecting the weeds, etc. and it can be solved by having a multitasking automated device. The complexity of use and repair can be solved by having a simple interface, useful technical manual, and a community base. The product suppose to fit in a customizable growing area that contain multiple types of crops. The farming device or machine can be built using reasonably reliable materials to have a less expensive product. Achieving the previous needs help with having a healthy and fresh self growing-crops, educational purposes, conducting researches in labs, and working in interesing projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/04_conceptsel/","title":"Concept Selection","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Method In this section of the report the team will demonstrate the various methods used to select the final concept, and the different studies/analyses conducted. First, the report will show benchmarking of multiple concepts to validate the targeted specifications and their availability in the market, where the team has selected a total of 6 concepts that are mentioned below in detail to compare with one another. The team has made the decision to include both large-scale and small-scale options due to the lack of small-scale solutions in the market.\nConcept 1 Tertill Tertill is a solar-powered weeding robot that looks for weeds every day. It has a solar panel placed on the top and provides it with all the power needed to detect the weeds within an area of (200 [ft^2], 18.6 [m^2]). There are two techniques to prevent the weeds from growing in the planting area. The first technique uses a weed whacker that cuts the weed depending on the plant\u0026rsquo;s height and it will cut all the plants below half-inch height. The second technique is preventing the weeds from growing during their vulnerable stages by moving the soils repeatedly around them using its wheels. The device uses a touch panel with a good sensitivity level to detect the actual plants and to prevent running into them. The body of the device is made of polycarbonate which can stand through hot and cold climate conditions. There are some limitations to using the device correctly. The device might mistake a short plant for weed and to prevent that, each newly planted seed must be surrounded by a physical barrier longer than half-inch. The plants must be spaced a foot apart from each other for the device to move between them. The weed wacker should be replaced and it lasts for one or two months. The soil level should be balanced to have better performance and prevent the wheels from getting stuck. The device uses a lithium battery that can be charged and keeps the device working through the night. The\nConcept 2 Dino Dino is an automated weeding machine for high scale farming. It uses deep learning to detect the plants, uses a real-time kinematic GPS, sensors, and cameras to navigate and scan the surroundings. It can count the plants and can-do crops mapping. It uses electricity to do the tasks and drive the four motors which are connected to the wheels. The machine covers about 40468.6 [m^2] per day. The price is expected to start from 50,000$ to 100,000$.\nConcept 3 Farmbot Farmbot Genesis is an open-source farming gantry system that can do multiple tasks such as watering, planting, health monitoring, weed detection, and weed elimination. It can do tasks in three dimensions which are the X, Y, and Z-axis. It needs to be connected to electricity around the clock to do its job all the time. The Genesis XL has dimensions of 3 [m] of gantry width and 6 [m] track length which results in 18 [m^2] of planting area. It can grow plants within the maximum height which is 0.5 [m]. Farmbot cost 4,995$ for the Genesis XL latest version.\nConcept 4 AVO AVO is a fully automated robot that is used to eradicate weeds. It is powered by solar panels and equipped with a lidar system that detects obstacles and people. AVO includes embedded software for treating a variety of crops. Additionally, it includes a mobile application that enables remote control. It consumes 95% fewer weedkillers than conventional methods. AVO is 750 kg in weight and uses an ultra-targeted spraying method with an accuracy of 8 x 3 cm to reach each plant. It can cover up to ten hectares per day.\nConcept 5 MARS MARS is a seed-planting mobile agriculture robot. It uses satellite navigation and cloud-based data management to track the location and planting time of each seed. Additionally, it employs an algorithm to determine the optimal path and time required to complete the task. MARS can operate in swarms of six to twelve units that cover an area of one hectare per hour. MARS electric motors have a rating of 400 W and consume 70% less energy than tractors. It is simple to assemble, compact in size, lightweight, and easy to maintain.\nConcept 6 Argas T-16 The Argas T-16 is an automated agriculture drone used to water large areas of plants. It is equipped with a 16-liter tank, four delivery pumps, and eight sprinklers. The drone can cover ten hectares per hour. It is equipped with a radar system that utilizes digital beamforming technology to operate the drone at any time of day or night. Additionally, this technology scans the area for obstacles. The drone\u0026rsquo;s control range is 3 kilometers. Under normal operating conditions, the Argas T-16 is dustproof, waterproof, and corrosion-resistant. Figure 23: Concept 6 (Argas T-16) 34\nComparison between concepts To compare the aforementioned concepts and products that are available the team has drawn up a concept selection matrix. The concept selection matrix is the resulting matrix from comparing multiple concepts with one another to help select the final design, in this process the team used available products in the market and benchmarked them with the list of customer needs generated in phase 1. Below the matrix is present, and the key for each needs to help in reading and understanding the table.

Making the decision to go with Farmbot as the starting point for development in this project is the obvious decision due to it meeting the required criteria and covering a wide range of the desired customer needs.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/05_manufacturing/","title":"Manufacturing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Manufacturing "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/","title":"Home","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Abstract Automated farming was targeted for the roots in has in sustainability and self-sufficient systems, the numbers have shown that self-sufficiency in agriculture is a problem worth solving in Kuwait and the world. Awareness is increasing and it’s driving the demand for sustainable solutions which was validated with market research. A collaboration with a company that builds autonomous agricultural robots, Farmbot, forms the base for this project where the feasibility of the product is studied for the region showing promising results of break-even period less than 3 years for the worst case. The weeding mechanism was switched from motors to efficient lasers with no moving components, which eliminated unwanted vibrations and power draws. The laser was evaluated by developing a totally separate weed detection and elimination method in MATLAB using smart vision systems and a 3D printer assembly. Components required for the Farmbot upgrade were designed, and prototypes were built and tested to confirm that the expected outcomes were achieved.\nThis is the link\nThis website is powered by no body documentation to learn how to use click on this\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/conceptgen/","title":"Concept Generations","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Concept Generation The team conducted extensive research on existing solutions in the market for both large- and small-scale applications when developing the concept for this project. After spending sufficient time independently researching solutions, the team decided to hold a meeting for a couple of brainstorming sessions during which they employed a variety of brainstorming strategies and concluded the series of brainstorming sessions with a set of concept sketches generated using the C-sketch method, as illustrated below.\nIdea 1 The concept presented in the figure above suggests the use of drones, each with specific functionality, and all drones are dispatched from a base. The drones are self-controlled and are connected with a detection system that is equipped with multiple sensors buried underground and a smart vision system. The main advantage of this system is the flexibility of the growing area as it is not bounded by a frame and the requirements are the same for a wide range of growing areas. The main problem with the system is the complexity of the autonomous drone system and the high possibility of failure combined with the difficulty of troubleshooting.\nIdea 2 The second generated concept proposes a rail system that goes around the growing area, and the rail system itself is the method of delivery for supplies. Mounting holes in fixed distances are present on the rails and an arm that moves on the rails and connects to the ports/holes is used to deliver the supplies from the storage area to the desired location. Supplies transported in the rail system can range from supplements to water and seeds. An advantage of this system is the simple components to be used in it and their availability in the market, with the main disadvantage being the limited growing area and the high number of parts.\nIdea 3 The third developed concept suggests the use of a greenhouse as the mainframe with a railing system embedded inside of it similar to the one discussed in the previously proposed solution (I2). other than the rail system the greenhouse is equipped with climate control components which is a desired feature in the region due to the extreme weather conditions. The added benefit for this concept above what was earlier mentioned is the wide range of plants available for growing because of the greenhouse, which also introduces the limitation of the growing area and the required maintenance of the arm and rail system.\nIdea 4 The last generated concept proposes the use of a camera in combination with sensors buried in the ground as the input to the system with a system of pipes underground to deliver supplies and water to the plants. The camera and sensors will monitor the health of plants and growing stages. This system should be easily upgradable due to the simplicity of components used, the main disadvantage is the high pumpkin power required for the delivery of supplies and the difficulty associated with repairing and changing faulty sensors. The concepts generated were discussed briefly to show the process used in the concept generation phase, all concepts have more depth than what is shown and mentioned, only the relevant information was mentioned. And the final selected concept is discussed thoroughly in the following stages of the report\nFinal Selected Idea After numerous discussion sessions, the team has decided on a combination of Ideas 2 and 3, where it will be a frame system with a simple arm that moves alongside it and will be located inside a temperature-controlled greenhouse. The system will meet the following specifications and include the following features:\n A greenhouse with lights and a camera attached to the ceiling The greenhouse with a fan to control airflow and temperature The greenhouse with a humidifier to control humidity The greenhouse with a rail system on the outside edge The module with an arm that is vertical when not in use A module carrying the arm that has a predetermined location for it to rest and connect to the valve/connection The tracks also serve as the delivery system for water and supplements The connection/valve on the track is how the water and supplements get from the tracks to the arm The arm is considered a rail that has a module connected to it with the necessary tools (Soil PH - soil temp - soil humidity - Solid health) A camera mounted on the green house\u0026rsquo;s ceiling will monitor the emergence of weeds and plant growth, as well as determine when crops are ready for harvest. Automatically triggered lights on the ceiling will simulate sunlight and provide necessary exposure.

The team has selected the Farmbot product as the starting point for their development. This decision was made for various reasons with the primary factor - contributing to this decision-making process - being the fact that in the benchmarking table shown previously the Farmbot concept covers most of the required target specifications discussed in the phase 1 report. Other important reasons have also played a great role in making the decision and they are listed below.\nCourse and budget limitations Unfortunately, the nature of this Capstone Design Course offers limited resources and a short timeline for the delivery of a proven and prototyped concept which in a way forces the team to settle with a simple or minor concept/problem to develop or fix. Thus, after looking at the various concepts discussed in the previous section from both budget and timeline perspectives the best decision was to select an already available concept in the market and direct the efforts of the team and their available resources to solve a problem with the existing concept or enhance its performance. For the limitations, the team has decided to select the Farmbot option shown previously.\nRequired experience and manufacturing capability Fully developing a concept from the ground up to require a great deal of previous experience which the team has none. Also, the lack of workshops in Kuwait and on-campus in combination with the limited raw material available especially for prototyping poses a barrier in the face of development and manufacturing.\nOther reasons After contacting the manufacturer of Farmbot, the team was able to get crucial information about one of the mechanisms available in the product, which was the undesired weed wacking mechanism on the device (this will be discussed extensively later on), this mechanism introduced undesired vibrations to the system and had a fairly large minimum radius. The team was also able to coordinate with the manufacturer of Farmbot to figure out a procedure to use their developed design and weeding mechanism to be added to the open- source Farmbot project, meaning that the development done in this course will be used in a real-life project that other people can use for no cost, this fact contributed greatly in the selection of Farmbot. After further discussion with the people working on the Farmbot project it was decided that the team needs to do is develop a new weed eliminating mechanism thus it eliminated the cost of acquiring the full automated farming device, and now the team only needs to use minimal parts from the actual Farmbot device to make sure their developed concept is compliant with Farmbot and work on the integration from the newly developed concept side of things (will be discussed extensively).\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/functional-decomposition/","title":"Functional Decomposition","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Watering This diagram illustrates the function decomposition for automatic plant watering. Three system inputs are required: energy in the form of electrical power, water in the form of a fluid, and a command informing the system that it is time to water the plants. The system has two outputs: water to be released on the plants and a signal confirming the plant watering process. When the energy input is accepted as external energy and used to increase the water pressure, the water input is accepted by the system, and the command indicating the plant\u0026rsquo;s needs is accepted, the watering process is initiated. The system will accept the water input and use the energy input to increase the pressure of the water, which will then wait at the end of a valve for the watering input command to release the water flow and accomplish the objective of watering the plants, triggering the output.\nWeeding The figure above illustrates the functional decomposition required for weeding. After receiving the command to check for weeds, the system uses electrical energy to scan the area and, if a weed is detected, the system moves the weeder in accordance with the weed\u0026rsquo;s location and size. After that, the weeder will begin eradicating the weed and will signal when it is complete. In contrast, if the area is scanned and no weeds are detected, the system will transmit a signal indicating that no weeds were detected. The weeding functional decomposition helped with choosing the mechanisms and techniques of the subsystems as follow: The figure above shows the classification tree for accepting the external energy. Answering the following questions were useful to choose the techniques:\n What kind of energy need to be saved? Is it a renewable power source or it doesn’t matter? What kind of power source? Results in choosing the wall outlet which is a non-renewable power source for electrical energy.  The figure above shows the classification tree for weed elimination. Answering the following questions was useful to choose the techniques:\n What are the techniques that can be used? Is it a combination of more than one? What tools can be used for each technique? Result in choosing a laser which is an electrical tool capable of burning the weeds.  The figure above shows the classification tree for the area scanning techniques Answering the following questions were useful to choose the techniques:\n What kind of scanner needs to be used? What kind of scanning tool? How does the scanning tool work? Result in choosing a regular video camera to scan the planting area and looks for weeds.  Seed Planting This figure shows the functional decomposition for seed planting. The system has three inputs: energy in the form of electrical power to supply the system with the necessary power to perform the tasks, The seeds are used as the planting material, and a command is used to inform the system about the plants. The system has two outputs: the seed as the material pushed beneath the soil at the proper depth and a signal informing the system of the planting\u0026rsquo;s completion and information. When external energy is accepted and used to power the seed collection and planting mechanisms, seeds are stored and planted, and the planting command is accepted to initiate the planting process, the inputs and outputs interact.\nSupplement System This figure shows the functional breakdown of the supplement system. The system will begin by scanning for deficiencies in the plants and storing the necessary supplements. The system will then send a signal indicating the location and type of supplement required if a deficiency is detected in a plant. Following that, it will direct the nozzle to the desired location and increase the supplement\u0026rsquo;s pressure using electrical energy. This process results in the release of the supplement onto the plant, along with a signal indicating its presence. If no deficiency is detected, the system will send a signal indicating that the plant did not require additional nutrients.\nClimate Control This is figure illustrates the functional decomposition for the climate control system. The system has five inputs: energy in the form of electrical power, water as the fluid, and three signals that inform the system about the temperature, humidity, and time. The system produces no outputs because it is constantly monitoring the climate conditions. The system is designed to accept ally electrical energy, and distribute it to the conditioning devices. Accept the water and use it to humidify or dehumidify the surrounding environment. The system will determine whether the current climate conditions are desirable or not and will turn on/off the conditioning devices accordingly.\nHarvesting This is the harvesting system\u0026rsquo;s functional decomposition. The system will begin scanning the area immediately for crops that require harvesting. If crops are detected, the system transmits a signal to the picker indicating their location, which the picker then moves to using electrical energy. The picker will then collect the crops and determine if additional crops need to be harvested or stored. If, on the other hand, the system detects that the crops are still growing, it will send a signal indicating that no further action is required.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/02_missionstatement/missionstatement/","title":"Mission Statement","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The first step in developing any project especially when it is focused and the attempt of solving a real-life problem that can touch the lives of a great deal of people is to have a well-defined well written mission statement and use it to guide the efforts of the team towards the solution.

Precision of watering 5 % high 75% since all that is required to to water the area that the plant is in and the water will get soaked up and the plant can get it through its roots   15 13 Min Radius of watering (plant) 1 mm medium - doesnt matter after further analysis   16 13 Max Radius of watering (plant) 4 mm high 1m to make sure the area of any plant is covered   17 13 Nozzle exit pressure 4 kPa low 65 to 200 kPa to allow for the water to reach the desired lication and not harm the plants when its relaeased on top of it and this range is availble domestically and in most buildings thus it might eliminate the need of a pump   18 13 Resolution of amount of water released 4 mL/s medium 10 mL/s this is to be conntrolled to not over/under water the plants - cant be decided now since it is related to the nozzle exit size   19 14 Resolution of measurement 3 C low 1C no further res is rquired since all that is needed is to be within the range of the desired temperature and deviation by the amount of the desired value for the target wouldnt have a substantial effect for the use case of the device   20 14 Range of measurement 3 C medium 0 to 60C Most plants (for the use of the device to be built can only be grown in that range)   21 14 Accuracy and Precision of measurement 3 % medium 1 to 3% equipment is widely availble and all that is needed is be in range of a required temperatue   22 17 Avg no. of steps for each task 3 no. of steps low - must be compared with other devices on the market (will be decided in the benchmarking process)   23 3 Accuracy and Precision of detection 5 % high 90% this value needs to be high since it is somewhat harmful for the plant to not be watered when it is needed and for thart to be repeated multiple times   24 4 Accuracy and Precision of detection 5 % high 90% weeds will feed on the resources that are avialble for the main plants so they must be eliminated as soon as the emerge hence a high accuracy is required   25 7 Accuracy and Precision of detection 5 % high 70% leaving a crop for a while before harvesting it would/shouldnt have a huge effect (even getting it before it is 100% ripe)   26 9 No. of steps to setup 4 No. of steps low - must be compared with other devices on the market (will be decided in the benchmarking process)   27 9 Ease of setup 4 Custom rating high - must be compared with other devices on the market (will be decided in the benchmarking process)   28 9 Ease of use 4 Custom rating high - must be compared with other devices on the market (will be decided in the benchmarking process)   29 9 Ease of troubleshooting 4 Custom rating high - must be compared with other devices on the market (will be decided in the benchmarking process)   30 16 Types of crops that can be harvested 2 List long list - -   31 16 Crops storage area 1 m3 high - To be specified later   32 21 No. of supplement type that can be stored 3 Count medium 4 to 6 since multiple suppliments are usually needed - maybe the device can have an nexpansion kit   33 21 Amount of supplement that can be stored 2 L medium 2 to 3 L To allow for the storage of multiple types of suppliments (different compartments adding up to 2 to 3L with 500ml for each)   34 21 Exit pressure of supplement deliv. system 2 kPa low 65 to 200 kPa Similar to water exit pressure   35 20 Resolution of control (level of humidity) 3 % medium 2% to 5% all is required is to be within the range of the desired RH values   36 20 Time to change 1% of rel. humidity per m3 3 S/m3 low 10min since the range needed shouldnt vary by too much and the existance for this system is just to maintain the required value (10 min) should be enough. it should also be able to completly change the number but can take longer times to setup if it rquirees to go from 10% to 80% for example   37 22 power rating of system 3 Watt low 50 to 150W within the range of a small home appliance - excluding greenhouse env. control - in standby it should be as close as possible to 0   38 22 % of Area Covered 3 % high 100% Must cover the entire growing area to achive the required effect of emitating the sun   39 22 WaveLength Range 5 nm custom 400-700nm This is the range of wavvelength that replicate the sun   40 23 Resolution of control (level of Temp) 3 C decent 1 to 3C All that is needed is to be within the vicinity of the required growing temperature   41 23 Time to change temp 1C (Heating) 2 min low 15 Faster change is not rquired for the application   42 23 Time to change temp 1C (cooling) 2 min low 15 Faster change is not rquired for the application   43 19 Can be controlled by remotely 4 Binary Yes Yes Not needed    The first column of the previous table shows the number of the metric, the following column represents the number of the needs related to that specific metric which can be used to cross- reference with the former needs table. The third column shows the metric itself followed by its importance in the next column, and finally, the unit for each metric can be found in the last column.\nTarget Specifications The product specifications are objective, precise, and measurements of the product performance and by meeting the specifications, the product meets customer requirements as defined in the Textbook. In order to obtain the specifications, the customer needs were organized into a hierarchy and each need was assigned with an importance and a metric as it was shown in the presented information above. The current target specifications are based on the components available in the market and/or the interpreted needs based on the understanding of the team members. The target specifications discussed below are not final and are subject to change after further market research is done. The change will be made with the objective of positioning the developed product in the area that allows for targeting the desired customer and keeping the costs as low as possible. The assumed target specifications are shown in table xx below with the justification (if any) for each one of them.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/05_manufacturing/prototype-1/","title":"Prototype I","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Prototype I "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
