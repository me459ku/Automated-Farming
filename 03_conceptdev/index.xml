After spending sufficient time independently researching solutions, the team decided to hold a meeting for a couple of brainstorming sessions during which they employed a variety of brainstorming strategies and concluded the series of brainstorming sessions with a set of concept sketches generated using the C-sketch method, as illustrated below.</description></item><item><title>B - Product Specifications</title><link>https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/prodspecs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 09:40:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/prodspecs/</guid><description>Customer Requirements and Importance To make use of the customer, the customer needs previously gathered in the initial market research stage must first be interpreted into semi-technical terms where the team can use to base their design and functionality. After the interpretation of the needs, it is also required to assign an importance rating for each of the interpreted customers' needs to help the team decide what needs they answer in their first iteration or so-called their minimum viable product.</description></item><item><title>C - Functional Decomposition</title><link>https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/functional-decomposition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 09:40:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://me459ku.github.io/Automated-Farming/03_conceptdev/functional-decomposition/</guid><description>Watering This diagram illustrates the function decomposition for automatic plant watering. Three system inputs are required: energy in the form of electrical power, water in the form of a fluid, and a command informing the system that it is time to water the plants. The system has two outputs: water to be released on the plants and a signal confirming the plant watering process. When the energy input is accepted as external energy and used to increase the water pressure, the water input is accepted by the system, and the command indicating the plant&amp;rsquo;s needs is accepted, the watering process is initiated.</description></item></channel></rss>
