- 	Kuwait has a major issue in self-sufficient systems especially in the agriculture field, the percentage of self-sufficient agriculture has been dropping since 2015 (latest statistics available for 2019), which is a problem worth solving.
-	A market for self-sufficient and sustainable systems exists in the region and the customer awareness is increasing.
- 	Open-source projects are gaining more traction and are of high appeal to customers, especially when products can be upgradable and customizable.
- 	Using visual tools for project planning can dramatically increase the efficiency of information communicated throughout the team, an example used is Gantt charts.
- 	Functional decomposition is a powerful technique that can be used to influence the decision-making process when upgrading a specific functionality in a device with multiple sub-systems.
- 	Automation is taking over the agriculture industry as some devices can simply replace tens if not hundreds of employees and do the job more efficiently.
- 	Solutions for automation in the agriculture industry have been limited to large scale farms with very expensive equipment making the barrier of entry huge for the world of automation.
-	Farmbot (the selected concept) is one of the first eco-systems that offer a multi-level automation and is targeted for actual farming and not just maintaining a single plant.
- 	Farmbot can be used in a plethora of scenarios ranging from greenhouses to labs and simply outdoor in the sun, with the capability of customizing each device to serve specific goals for specific conditions and different objectives.
- 	The economic analysis showed that Farmbot is a feasible device to be used in Kuwait with a breakeven period of less than 3 years in the worst-case scenario.
- 	Economic analysis concluded that Farmbot is a feasible solution for households and showed promising results for restaurants with the dream to use exotic produce all year long.
- 	Contacting the manufacturer of a product is a necessary step to validate a problem thought to exist in a device before attempting to solve it â€“ it can also lead to a collaboration with the manufacturer.
- 	Using multiple levels for proof of concept is an efficient technique before fully investing in a solution that does not deliver on results.
- 	Teamwork is a crucial aspect in the development of any project/product since all members have different backgrounds and skills that can influence the success of the project differently.
