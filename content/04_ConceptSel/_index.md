## Method
In this section of the report the team will demonstrate the various methods used to select the final concept, and the different studies/analyses conducted. First, the report will show benchmarking of multiple concepts to validate the targeted specifications and their availability in the market, where the team has selected a total of 6 concepts that are mentioned below in detail to compare with one another. The team has made the decision to include both large-scale and small-scale options due to the lack of small-scale solutions in the market.


#### Concept 1 Tertill

Tertill is a solar-powered weeding robot that looks for weeds every day. It has a solar panel placed on the top and provides it with all the power needed to detect the weeds within an area of (200 [ft^2], 18.6 [m^2]). There are two techniques to prevent the weeds from growing in the planting area. The first technique uses a weed whacker that cuts the weed depending on the plant's height and it will cut all the plants below half-inch height. The second technique is preventing the weeds from growing during their vulnerable stages by moving the soils repeatedly around them using its wheels. The device uses a touch panel with a good sensitivity level to detect the actual plants and to prevent running into them. The body of the device is made of polycarbonate which can stand through hot and cold climate conditions. There are some limitations to using the device correctly. The device might mistake a short plant for weed and to prevent that, each newly planted seed must be surrounded by a physical barrier longer than half-inch. The plants must be spaced a foot apart from each other for the device to move between them. The weed wacker should be replaced and it lasts for one or two months. The soil level should be balanced to have better performance and prevent the wheels from getting stuck. The device uses a lithium battery that can be charged and keeps the device working through the night. The 
 
 
 
 #### Concept 2 Dino
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me459ku/Automated-Farming/16131ecf0a98884adcfbc39a55c8f002ee84aba6/img/Dino.png)
Dino is an automated weeding machine for high scale farming. It uses deep learning to detect the plants, uses a real-time kinematic GPS, sensors, and cameras to navigate and scan the surroundings. It can count the plants and can-do crops mapping. It uses electricity to do the tasks and drive the four motors which are connected to the wheels. The machine covers about 40468.6 [m^2] per day. The price is expected to start from 50,000$ to 100,000$.


#### Concept 3 Farmbot

Farmbot Genesis is an open-source farming gantry system that can do multiple tasks such as watering, planting, health monitoring, weed detection, and weed elimination. It can do tasks in three dimensions which are the X, Y, and Z-axis. It needs to be connected to electricity around the clock to do its job all the time. The Genesis XL has dimensions of 3 [m] of gantry width
and 6 [m] track length which results in 18 [m^2] of planting area. It can grow plants within the maximum height which is 0.5 [m]. Farmbot cost 4,995$ for the Genesis XL latest version.


#### Concept 4 AVO
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me459ku/Automated-Farming/16131ecf0a98884adcfbc39a55c8f002ee84aba6/img/Avo.png)
AVO is a fully automated robot that is used to eradicate weeds. It is powered by solar panels and equipped with a lidar system that detects obstacles and people. AVO includes embedded software for treating a variety of crops. Additionally, it includes a mobile application that enables remote control. It consumes 95% fewer weedkillers than conventional methods. AVO is 750 kg in weight and uses an ultra-targeted spraying method with an accuracy of 8 x 3 cm to reach each plant. It can cover up to ten hectares per day.


#### Concept 5 MARS
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me459ku/Automated-Farming/16131ecf0a98884adcfbc39a55c8f002ee84aba6/img/Mars.png)
MARS is a seed-planting mobile agriculture robot. It uses satellite navigation and cloud-based data management to track the location and planting time of each seed. Additionally, it employs an algorithm to determine the optimal path and time required to complete the task. MARS can operate in swarms of six to twelve units that cover an area of one hectare per hour. MARS electric motors have a rating of 400 W and consume 70% less energy than tractors. It is simple to assemble, compact in size, lightweight, and easy to maintain.


#### Concept 6 Argas T-16
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me459ku/Automated-Farming/16131ecf0a98884adcfbc39a55c8f002ee84aba6/img/Argas.png)
The Argas T-16 is an automated agriculture drone used to water large areas of plants. It is equipped with a 16-liter tank, four delivery pumps, and eight sprinklers. The drone can cover ten hectares per hour. It is equipped with a radar system that utilizes digital beamforming technology to operate the drone at any time of day or night. Additionally, this technology scans the area for obstacles. The drone's control range is 3 kilometers. Under normal operating conditions, the Argas T-16 is dustproof, waterproof, and corrosion-resistant.

### Comparison between concepts
To compare the aforementioned concepts and products that are available the team has drawn up a concept selection matrix. The concept selection matrix is the resulting matrix from comparing multiple concepts with one another to help select the final design, in this process the team used available products in the market and benchmarked them with the list of customer needs generated in phase 1. Below the matrix is present, and the key for each needs to help in reading and understanding the table. In each column, a [+] represent a need being met with ... better than the target specification, a [0] shows that either the product doesn't have the required feature or it can be upgraded to allow for the required feature, a [-] value indicated that the feature doesnâ€™t exist and in no way the product can allow for making it available.

Net Score| |-8|-10|12|-8|-10|-3
Rank| |3|5|1|3|5|2

The table above shows the results for the selection matrix, as it is seen that most of the products have a net score of (-) and this is due to the reason that the customer needs were generated with the targeted customer being small scale and home farmers, and as it was mentioned in the phase 1 report that the majority of the available products in the market serves the large scale farming industry with no regards to the small sale consumer, and since the target is the small scale farmer, purchasing multiple devices to automate multiple tasks is not feasible. Making the decision to go with Farmbot as the starting point for development in this project is the obvious decision due to it meeting the required criteria and covering a wide range of the desired customer needs.
