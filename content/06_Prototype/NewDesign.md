### Redesigned components for Farmbot

As mentioned before Farmbot devices use a universal tool mount that can be attached to a different type of tools to do a certain task. A laser housing was designed using COMSOL to be used in the weed elimination process. To have a better understanding of the designed parts look at the figure below which shows the part from four different dimensions. The final design should be able to be attached to the Farmbot weeder tool using a couple of screws.

After designing the final model of the laser housing was manufactured by a 3D printer using a filament made of thermoplastic polymer (PLA) which is made of renewable resources (recycled material). The laser was able to fit inside the housing with a very small clearance of value 1 [mm] at each side. The minimum wall thickness equals to 2.25 [mm] which can be seen on the top walls of the cylinder. The final 3D printed laser housing is shown in the figure below.
The figure below shows the Farmbot weeder tool which can be attached to their universal tool mount using magnets as mentioned before. It can be manufactured using a 3D printer and it is shown in the figures below.

The laser housing can relate to the weeder tool using a couple of screws as shown in the figures below.

After connecting the laser housing with the weeder tool, it will be
ready to attach it with the universal tool mount which is equipped
with most of Farmbot devices. The three big holes on the top of the weeder tool are for attaching the magnets with it using screws. The other small holes on the around the weeder top are for the wiring. To achieve the target, which is eliminating the weed, The laser should have enough power to burn the weed. The used laser made by Creality, and it has a blue violet beam. The laser has enough power of 500 mA, and it can burn a weed and it is shown in the figure below.

The figure above shows the laser wiring and all the needed fasteners from a Top view. The Laser has two wires which can be used to connect the laser with Farmbot devices.The Wires use the small holes of the weeder tool and they can be connected with universal tool mount using the electronic screws to supply the laser with required power and using the magnets to attach and carry the whole tool.
## 
The final design should be ready to work after connecting it with a Farmbot devise using the universal tool mount, The red wire will be connected to a Farmbot power supply, and the black wire will be connected with a Farmbot board. The same method will be used to detect the weeds as the other weed killing tools which Farmbot already designed. The figure below shows the expected final design attached to the Farmbot gantry system through the universal tool mount.
