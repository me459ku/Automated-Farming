Due to the previously mentioned reasons and the inability to acquire and set up a fully functional Farmbot device the team has decided to split the validation of the problem-solution into multiple segments and by doing so the team will also better satisfy the engineering analysis objective of this capstone project with hands-on experience in mimicking the behavior of a Farmbot by developing its own autonomous weed like detection software to identify objects and burn them with laser as if they were weeds. The team has also made sure that the laser module used is capable of burning weed in the second section of this validation process, and finally, the components to integrate the laser module with Farmbot were designed using CAD software and fabricated and tested for fit using a 3D printer.
