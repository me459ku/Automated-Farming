## Market Research
Before making any presuppositions, the team have decided to conduct thorough market research using the methods available to them. The team had the opportunity to interview people with some “skin in the game”. The questions were quoted from the textbook of the course “Product Design and Development by Ulrich and Eppinger” to help minimize bias when writing the question. This exercise has provided the team with a substantial amount of information to use as the keystone for the development of the project and to assess the market needs. The raw data gathered from the customers is present below in the form of a question and answer.
#### When would you use this product?
Desire healthy/fresh/organic self-grown crops at home Conducting research in labs or a personal experiment Educational tool to satisfy most STEM objectives Interesting project to work on and manage (enthusiasts)
 #### Why would you use this product?
To automate farming/growing tasks such as Water plants
Planting seeds
Eliminate weeds
Monitor the health of plants
Control the environment (greenhouse)
Supplement plant (health management through vitamins and pH) Harvest crops
#### Typical session of using this product?
Phase 1: (Plan growing needs - purchase seeds - ask the device to plant) Phase 2: (Device should plant seeds - the device should grow plants) Phase 3: Device must harvest crops
Phase 4: Clean and prep growing area for new cycle
#### What do you like about this product?
Community-based
Automate some tasks

Efficient and reliable (time-saving)
No assembly requirement
#### What do you dislike about this product?
Not enough small-scale options in the market
Most available solutions offer a single automation
Complexity of repairs & troubleshooting
Expensive to acquire
Small-scale has a very limited growing area
Limited crops variety in available solutions
#### What issues do you consider when purchasing the product? 
Price to acquire and fix
Ease of fixing and troubleshooting
Range of crops (types)
What is it automating (what tasks)
Ease of use and setup
Growing space/area
Indoor and outdoor capability
Is there a community built around the product?
Reliability
#### What improvements would you make to existing products? 
Automate multi-tasks
Upgradable
Custom-sized growing area
Easy to repair

The answers to the previous questions provided the team with the customer and market needs. They gave them an idea about the desired product which must contain the crucial needs. Most of the existing products are expensive to acquire, complex to use & repair, small scale, limited type of crops, and not more than one automated task. This showed that there is a shortage in the market of products that can do more than one automated tasks such as planting the seeds, watering the plants, monitoring the plants health, detecting the weeds, etc. and it can be solved by having a multitasking automated device. The complexity of use and repair can be solved by having a simple interface, useful technical manual, and a community base. The product suppose to fit in a customizable growing area that contain multiple types of crops. The farming device or machine can be built using reasonably reliable materials to have a less expensive product. Achieving the previous needs help with having a healthy and fresh self growing-crops, educational purposes, conducting researches in labs, and working in interesing projects.
