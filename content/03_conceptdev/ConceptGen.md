The team conducted extensive research on existing solutions in the market for both large- and small-scale applications when developing the concept for this project. After spending sufficient time independently researching solutions, the team decided to hold a meeting for a couple of brainstorming sessions during which they employed a variety of brainstorming strategies and concluded the series of brainstorming sessions with a set of concept sketches generated using the C-sketch method, as illustrated below.

### Idea 1

The concept presented in the figure above suggests the use of drones, each with specific functionality, and all drones are dispatched from a base. The drones are self-controlled and are connected with a detection system that is equipped with multiple sensors buried underground and a smart vision system. The main advantage of this system is the flexibility of the growing area as it is not bounded by a frame and the requirements are the same for a wide range of growing areas. The main problem with the system is the complexity of the autonomous drone system and the high possibility of failure combined with the difficulty of troubleshooting.
### Idea 2

The second generated concept proposes a rail system that goes around the growing area, and the rail system itself is the method of delivery for supplies. Mounting holes in fixed distances are present on the rails and an arm that moves on the rails and connects to the ports/holes is used to deliver the supplies from the storage area to the desired location. Supplies transported in the rail system can range from supplements to water and seeds. An advantage of this system is the simple components to be used in it and their availability in the market, with the main disadvantage being the limited growing area and the high number of parts.


### Idea 3

The third developed concept suggests the use of a greenhouse as the mainframe with a railing system embedded inside of it similar to the one discussed in the previously proposed solution (I2). other than the rail system the greenhouse is equipped with climate control components which is a desired feature in the region due to the extreme weather conditions. The added benefit for this concept above what was earlier mentioned is the wide range of plants available for growing because of the greenhouse, which also introduces the limitation of the growing area and the required maintenance of the arm and rail system.

### Idea 4

The last generated concept proposes the use of a camera in combination with sensors buried in the ground as the input to the system with a system of pipes underground to deliver supplies and water to the plants. The camera and sensors will monitor the health of plants and growing stages. This system should be easily upgradable due to the simplicity of components used, the main disadvantage is the high pumpkin power required for the delivery of supplies and the difficulty associated with repairing and changing faulty sensors.
The concepts generated were discussed briefly to show the process used in the concept
generation phase, all concepts have more depth than what is shown and mentioned, only the
relevant information was mentioned. And the final selected concept is discussed thoroughly in the following stages of the report

### Final Selected Idea

After numerous discussion sessions, the team has decided on a combination of Ideas 2 and 3, where it will be a frame system with a simple arm that moves alongside it and will be located inside a temperature-controlled greenhouse.
The system will meet the following specifications and include the following features:
-  A greenhouse with lights and a camera attached to the ceiling 
-  The greenhouse with a fan to control airflow and temperature 
-  The greenhouse with a humidifier to control humidity
- The greenhouse with a rail system on the outside edge
- The module with an arm that is vertical when not in use
- A module carrying the arm that has a predetermined location for it to rest and connect to the valve/connection
- The tracks also serve as the delivery system for water and supplements
- The connection/valve on the track is how the water and supplements get from the tracks to the arm
- The arm is considered a rail that has a module connected to it with the necessary tools (Soil PH - soil temp - soil humidity - Solid health)
- A camera mounted on the green house's ceiling will monitor the emergence of weeds and plant growth, as well as determine when crops are ready for harvest.
- Automatically triggered lights on the ceiling will simulate sunlight and provide necessary exposure.
