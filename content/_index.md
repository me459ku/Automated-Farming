# Abstract

Automated farming was targeted for the roots in has in sustainability and self-sufficient systems, the numbers have shown that self-sufficiency in agriculture is a problem worth solving in Kuwait and the world. Awareness is increasing and itâ€™s driving the demand for sustainable solutions which was validated with market research. A collaboration with a company that builds autonomous agricultural robots, Farmbot, forms the base for this project where the feasibility of the product is studied for the region showing promising results of break-even period less than 3 years for the worst case. The weeding mechanism was switched from motors to efficient lasers with no moving components, which eliminated unwanted vibrations and power draws. The laser was evaluated by developing a totally separate weed detection and elimination method in MATLAB using smart vision systems and a 3D printer assembly. Components required for the Farmbot upgrade were designed, and prototypes were built and tested to confirm that the expected outcomes were achieved.
