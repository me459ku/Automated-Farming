This section of the report will discuss the economics of purchasing a Farmbot, the ROI period is calculated for multiple scenarios for multiple versions of the Farmbot device. In the beginning the assumptions made for the ROI calculation are discussed. The first table shows the cost to acquire a Farmbot and have it shipped to Kuwait.

**Device**|**Device (USD)**|**Shipping (USD)**|**Setup (USD)**|**Total (USD)**|**Total (KWD)**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Farmbot Express|1495|200|73|1768|535.704
Farmbot Genesis|3250|200|163|3613|1094.739
Farmbot Express XL|2000|400|100|2500|757.5
Farmbot Genesis XL|5000|400|250|5650|1711.95


The table above shows the complete cost to acquire a Farmbot and set it up all the way from placing an order online to having it ready to grow in Kuwait. The first column shows the cost to acquire the different versions of the device in USD, the second column shows the estimated shipping cost to Kuwait (as per the quote sent to the team by Farmbot), the setup cost is the estimated cost of the time spent assembling the Farmbot kit as they arrive partially assembled. The last column shows the cost to acquire each device in KWD (the local currency). The upcoming tables shows the cost for the utilities associated with operating a Farmbot and other costs used in the ROI calculations.

**Electricity cost**|**0.01**|**KWD/kWh**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
water cost|2|KWD/thousand Gallon
Fuel cost|0.105|KWD/Liter
The average fuel consumption for cars|9.3|Liter/ 100 km

The time to complete the general tasks revolving around owning a Farmbot device are presented in the table below, with the cost for each task being calculated in the local currency KWD.

**item**|**consumption/month**|**Per consumption cost**|**Total**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Maintain Farmbot|2|7|14
harvest crops (Regular)|2.5|7|17.5
Harvest (XL)|5|7|35
Assemble regular|18|7|126
Assemble XL|25|7|175



The yield for the regular sized Farmbot Express and Genesis is set to a fixed value of 180cups per month and for the XL versions it is set to 432 cups. (These values were obtained from the Farmbot website in the ROI Section). The following calculation were made to estimate the average cost of each cup of vegetables in Kuwait and then calculate the cost for the entire amount of cups that can be produced by the respective farmbot device to be used in the final ROI calculation.


**item**|**Rocca**|**Potato**|**Broccoli**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
1 gram cost (Fils)|8|0.58|1.96
grams in 1 cup|5|159|91
1 cup|40|92.22|178.36
monthly cups|180|180|180
cost(Fils)/month|7200|16599.6|32104.8
Avg/month (KWD)|18634.8| | 
Avg/cup (KWD)|103.52| | 
Avg/Year (KWD)|223.62| | 






Finally the general cost for visiting the store and the other associated costs of running a farmbot are calculated (using the previously made assumptions). The first table is for running a regular sized Farmbot device and the second table shows the values for running an XL Farmbot device.

**item**|**Rocca**|**Potato**|**Broccoli**

1 gram cost (Fils)|8|0.58|1.96
grams in 1 cup|5|159|91

monthly cups|180|180|180

Avg/month (KWD)|18634.8| | 
Avg/cup (KWD)|103.52| |

Using all the data calculated above the team was able to generate the following studies to be found the upcoming pages
- 1 Farmbot Express vs store bought.
- 1 Farmbot Genesis vs store bought
- 1 Farmbot Express XL vs store bought
- 1 Farmbot Genesis XL vs store bought
- Scaling up using Farmbot Express XL(2-3-4-5) devices
- Scaling up using Farmbot Genesis XL (2-3-4-5) devices

*Detailed tables can be found in the appendix.
After generating the tables in the appendix the following graphs were plotted to better help understand the results. For the first two figures show the results for the small scale options of owning 1 device and the expenses over time associated with each of the options available to the consumer.

In the previously presented figures the numbers associated with operating and owning a Farmbot are plotted to help better understand the data. The first plot in the form aof a bar chat shows the cumulative expenses over the years, whereas the second plot show the break even points for all options available and as it can be noticed that the Farmbot Express will break even after approximately 6 months to a year whereas the Farmbot Genies breaks even before the 3 year mark and the costs associated with the buying the vegetables from stores keeps on increasing with a higher rate than either options of the Farmbot.
For the following graphs the same concept above is used but for a bigger sized growing area were made as the Farmbot family offers an XL version for both the Farmbot Express and the Farmbot Genies, and their respective calculations can be found in the following figures.

Similar to the figures above for the single regular size Farmbot the numbers for the XL versions of the Farmbot were studied and plotted as shown in figures 35 and 36. Both version the regular and the XL share about the same breakeven point, but as it will be discovered in the next part of the ROI study when upscaling with multiple devices more interesting results show up.
For the following and last section of the ROI calculations the comparison of owning multiple Farmbot devices were compared and the cumulative profit for each scenario was plotted against time as it can be found the two following figures.

For the figures above the 0 line represents the breakeven point for each device since each line in both plots represent the cumulative profit in comparison to simply buying the vegetables from stores (using previously made assumptions). As it can be noticed from figure 37 which shows the calculations for owning multiple Farmbot Express XL devices the breakeven point for all options ranging from owning 1 to 5 devices the breakeven point is met before the second quarter of the second year and this option shows promising results especially for restaurant owners who are looking for having exotic herbs and vegetables as parts of their menus. Another observation made from the plot is that at the point where all the lines share the same point is that at that specific point have more devices beats the numbers of having any less so the number
of devices owned can be derived only by the produce needs of the owner. For the second figure the same numbers were plotted but for the Farmbot Genies XL version and it is obvious that the device will cost more but yet it might have different use cases as this option offers a wider range of automations and different capabilities that might also be suited for the regular user or possibly to be used in labs which will have a different way for calculating the ROI since itâ€™s a completely different game.

### In Conclusion 
In conclusion Farmbot present itself as a feasible solution for multiple types of consumers especially that it is already a feasible solution when only considering produce that is available in the market and that is reasonably priced. Farmbot can be considered an even more feasible option when the consumer is trying to scratch more than one itch, it is an extremely appealing product to restaurants especially ones that would like to infuse their dishes with exotic vegetables and fruits that are not easy to find or extremely seasonal (will require extra investment for green house). Farmbot is also considered an amazing STEM project for to build as a family projecy or it can be used for even more complex applications in labs and other facilities for experimental purposes.
